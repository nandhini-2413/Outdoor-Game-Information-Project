    <h3 class="section-title">What is Kho-Kho?</h3>
    <p>
      Kho-Kho is a traditional Indian tag sport that requires quick reflexes, speed, teamwork, and smart strategy. Played by two teams of 12 players each (9 active on the field), the game revolves around chasing and tagging the opposing team in a fast-paced format.
    </p>
    <p>
      One team takes the chasing role, sitting in a straight line with alternating players facing opposite directions. A chaser runs around the field, tagging teammates to continue the chase, trying to touch or tag the runners from the opposing team.
    </p>

      <li>Fast turns, direction switches, and strategic tagging</li>
      <li>Focuses on agility, alertness, and teamwork</li>
      <li>No equipment needed — just lines and players</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">History & Growth</h4>
    <p>

      <li>Promotes a strong sense of teamwork and discipline</li>
      <li>Fun and inclusive for children and youth</li>
    </ul>
