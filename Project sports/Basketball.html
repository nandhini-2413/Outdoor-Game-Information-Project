    <h3 class="section-title">What is Basketball?</h3>
    <p>
      Basketball is a fast-paced sport played between two teams of five players who aim to score by shooting a ball through the opposing team’s hoop. It's known for its exciting gameplay, high jumps, and strategic teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players dribble, pass, and shoot to score points, while defending against the opponent. The team with the most points at the end of four quarters wins the game. It's played both indoors and outdoors, and is popular at schools, colleges, and professional levels worldwide.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">Key Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 players per team on the court</li>
      <li>Scoring via field goals (2 or 3 points) and free throws (1 point)</li>
      <li>High-energy sport requiring coordination and agility</li>
      <li>Played in 4 quarters of 10–12 minutes each</li>
      <li>Extremely popular Olympic and professional sport</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4 text-success">History & Growth</h4>
    <p>
      Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 in the USA. Originally designed as an indoor sport for athletes during winter, it quickly spread globally. Today, the NBA (National Basketball Association) is the premier professional league, and basketball is one of the most watched sports worldwide.

      <li>Requires minimal equipment — just a ball and hoop</li>
      <li>Accessible to all ages and widely promoted in schools</li>
    </ul>
